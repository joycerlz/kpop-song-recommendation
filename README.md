# Kpop Song Recommendation System

****_work in progress_****

Intro: TBD.

To create a K-pop song recommendation tool using my Spotify Kpop playlist and song features provided by Spotify based on user preferences

## To Run the App

Streamlit

## Data Engineering
**Spotify API:** I'm using the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) to fetch song metadata and audio features.

I manually combined 30+ random K-pop playlists created by other users into one playlist, removed duplicate songs, then fetched track metadata into the ```data/track_infoFull.csv``` file. I am using this file as my recommender database.

## Exploratory Data Analysis



## Challenges

- How to keep the database updated?
